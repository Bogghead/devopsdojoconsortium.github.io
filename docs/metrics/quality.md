# {{ page.title }}

Quality is measured as the percentage of finished work that is marked as defect
type for the reporting period.

### What is the intended behavior?

Help teams continuously triage and complete defect backlog items at a consistent
rate. Try and drive this percentage lower without deferring defects.

### How is it improved?

- Identify root cause.
- Add tests to prevent root cause.
- Review the team quality process and look for improvement items.

### How is it gamed?

- Defects are entered as additional stories (seen by growing throughput, but
  lowering customer satisfaction and complaints)

### When over-driven, what metrics are impacted?

- [WIP](./work-in-progress.html) metric increases for defect types.
- Feature delivery is impacted as defects are over prioritized.
