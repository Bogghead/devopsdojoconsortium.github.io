We are representatives from enterprose dojos who are collaborating to improve both the outcomes of our companies and the
quality of life of product teams using immersive learning techniques.

Each of the dojos operate in their particular contexts with individualized implementation, but the overall goal is to act as agents
of change to help teams improve the continuous flow of value to the end user.

DevOps is often used to mean different things and people new to DevOps often focus on tooling. You cannot buy DevOps and tools
represent a small portion of the solution. In our context, this is the guiding principle for "DevOps":

<blockquote>
DevOps should be defined by the outcomes. It is those sets of cultural norms and
technology practices that enable the fast flow of planned work from, among other
things, development through tests into operations, while preserving world class
reliability, operation, and security. DevOps is not about what you do, but what
your outcomes are. So many things that we associate with DevOps, such as
communication and culture, fit underneath this very broad umbrella of beliefs
and practices.<br><br>-- Gene Kim, 2014
