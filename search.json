  "content": "# {{ page.title }}## IntroductionOne of the most important coaching goals in a Dojo challenge is to inspire the team to understand the system view, specifically how value flows from ideation all the way to deployment and support. It isn&#39;t the &quot;First Way&quot; of DevOps for nothing. However, the question we often get sounds something like:&gt; Is it really necessary to train everyone regarding the overall system? Our developers need to be heads down and let the architects, RTE&#39;s, and other Program leaders manage the big picture.Of course as you read that question you can easily detect it resembles a defense of a well established management paradigm. Broaching this subject in your Dojo will require a healthy combination of some of these organizational attributes:* Understanding that DevOps is more than just pipeline tooling skills.* Sufficient framing and preparation with managers that the team will be empowered toward autonomy while entrusted to the Dojo.* Trust that the Dojo coaches are working toward the good of all, not just the team members.* Openness that despite how teams are currently aligned, that teams can contribute realignment insights to improve feature lead times. * A catching on of the fact that software architecture is a skill vs being a role.Even heavily matrixed organizations mired in a negative cycle of pointing people&#39;s attention back toward their siloed constraints are coming around to the realization that they must at least make the Value Stream visible in some way. We beleive the Dojo can demonstrate value to both the team and the programs they serve by establishing a Value Stream orientation in the early stages of the engagement. We map the value stream early on. We call out dependencies. We reduce handoffs where empowered. We report on the waste in handoffs where not empowered. In all this, we see time and time again that Value Stream orientation in the Dojo creates retained value for the team and creates viral value for other programs in the organization watching all this transpire.

  "title": "Value Stream Mapping Workshop",
  "url": "/docs/playbooks/lean/wm-vsm.html",
  "content": "# {{ page.title }}The purpose of Value Stream Mapping Workshop is to understand all of the steps needed todeliver value from conception to production. We can then use it as a tool toidentify constraints and propose improvements to the value stream.## Recommended Practices1. Everyone who has a touch point in the value stream should be present for the   exercise. This includes, but is not limited to, the developers, the   engineering manager, the product owner, and representatives from any external   teams that have required steps between idea and production.2. Start with an introduction to what value stream mapping is, and why it is important.### Explain the terms associated with value stream mapping- Build Cycle Time: Total duration of the build, from commit to deploy.- Development Cycle Time: The time from when work begins until it is deployed to production. Done.- Lead Time: The time taken from start to end of the value stream.- Process Time / Value Add Time: The time spent executing a particular process.- Wait Time / Non-value Time: The time between processes where no activity is occurring.- Percent Complete and Accurate: The percentage of work from a process that is   rejected by the next process. If coding fails code review 20% of the time,   it&#39;s %C/A is 80%.### Identify source of request*Example:* Refine EpicFor each source of _Requests_  1. What is the outcome of that step, or next step?  2. Who is involved in that step?  3. How long does this step take?  4. How long between the previous and current steps?### Identify Rework Loops for each step1. To which steps do we return to from this one for corrections?2. How often is work rejected from this step (percentage complete and accurate)?### Identify value added time, cycle time, and lead time1. What is the total value time (time spent doing work) from conception to production?2. What is the total non-value time (time waiting) from conception to production?## Outcomes- Visual representation of the value stream(s) of the team.- Identify possible constraints to flow based on value added time, cycle time, and lead time.## Tips- Involve all team members associated to any part of the process of getting value from conception to production.- Review and maintain value stream map to show wins associated to implementing improvement.- Take into account all potential flows for team processes, and value stream those as well.## ValueAs a team, we want to understand how to value stream map our team processes, so that we may understand bottlenecks associated to delivering value, and identify areas of improvement.## Acceptance Criteria- Value stream all things associated to delivering value.- Create action items of improvement from exercise.## References- [Value Stream Mapping Guide](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/value-stream-mapping-guide/)- [Value Stream Mapping: How to Visualize Work and Align Leadership for Organizational Transformation](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/value-stream-mapping/9780071828918/)"
